In this step we are creating a Dockerfile for centos.
For this first we need to create a folder inside image folder named as centos.<br>
`mkdir ~/Spark/image/centos`{{execute}}
<br>
<br>Now We are going to create Dockerfile inside the centos folder. But we already have a docker file we will just move to centos folder.<br>
`cp ~/test/Dockerfile ~/Spark/image/centos`{{execute}}

If you want to see the content of Dockerfile please execute below.<br>
`cat ~/Spark/image/centos/Dockerfile`{{execute}}
