In this step you will learn to create a Dockerfile for centos.
For this first we need to create a folder inside image folder named as centos.<br>
`mkdir ~/Mysql/image/centos`{{execute}}
<br>
<br>Now you are going to create Dockerfile inside the centos folder.
For reference, there's already a docker file.<br>You can just move the Dockerfile to centos folder.<br>
`cp ~/test/Dockerfile ~/Mysql/image/centos`{{execute}}

For viewing the content of Dockerfile please execute following command.<br>
`cat ~/Mysql/image/centos/Dockerfile`{{execute}}
