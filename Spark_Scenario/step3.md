Let's create Dockerfile now..

Create a Dockerfile inside centos/spark folder. For reference, we already have a Dockerfile in ~/test directory.
We can just copy the reference Dockerfile to Centos folder.<br>
`cp ~/test/Dockerfile ~/Spark/image/centos/spark`{{execute}}

To view the content of Dockerfile please execute the below command.<br>
`cat ~/Spark/image/centos/spark/Dockerfile`{{execute}}
