In this step we are creating a Dockerfile for centos.
For this first we need to create a folder inside image folder named as centos.

`mkdir ~/Spark/image/centos`{{execute}}

Now We are going to create Dockerfile inside the centos folder. But we already have a docker file we are just move to centos folder.
`cp ~/test/Dockerfile ~/Spark/image/centos`{{execute}}


Check the content of Dockerfile.
`cat ~/Spark/image/centos/Dokcerfile`{{execute}}
